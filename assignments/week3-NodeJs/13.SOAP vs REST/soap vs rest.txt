SOAP
->Simple Object Access Protocol
->communication protocol
->used for communication between applications
->provides format for sending messages
->SOAP communicates via Internet
->platform independent
->language independent
->SOAP is based on XML
->simple and extensible
->SOAP allows you to get around firewalls
->SOAP is a W3C recommendation

SOAP/WSDL web services are essentially a form of remote procedure calls over HTTP

SOAP documents is the XML messages exchanged over HTTP

SOAP comprise of a body as well as an optional header.

Header is an extensible container where message layer information can be encoded for a variety of purposes such as security, quality of service, transactions, etc.

A number of WS specifications have been developed to incorporate additional features into SOAP web services that extend and utilize the header container



REST
->Representational State Transfer
->Introduced as an architectural style for large-scale systems based on distributed resources.
->REST web services are simply HTTP requests to URIs
->Uses four methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE allowed by the HTTP protocol.
->Each URI identifies a resource, such as a record in a database.



SOAP vs REST
1)Location:
some end points can be behind corporate networks on non-HTTP connects in SOAP while in REST,all endpoints must be on the internet
 complex B2B scenarios require SOAP.
2)Security:
HTTPS which can be augmented with additional security layers in SOAP,Only HTTPS can be used for security in REST 

3)Efficiency
 XML parsing can be avoided by using JSON in REST while in SOAP , XML parsing is required.

4) Transactions:
 can be supported in SOAP,
cannot be supported in REST
situations requiring multi-request/multi-party transactions need SOAP.

5)Technology
Soap can work without HTTP,while REST relies on HTTP
REST is for pure internet communications and cannot mix other transports
6)Productivity
 Rest is high due to simplicity
 SOAP is low due to complex tools and skills required
 Rest is faster and cheaper for developers to use.
