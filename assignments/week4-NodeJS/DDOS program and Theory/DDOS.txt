					DDOS(Distributed Denial Of Service)
					-----------------------------------
I HAVE DONE AN IMPLEMENTAION OF HANDLING DDOS ATTACK THROUGH A CODE IN THE SAME FOLDER IN program.js FILE.

->DDOS attack is something in which a group of malicious computers(called as a botnet) attack on a particular     web serveer by sending lot of fraud requests and constant FLODDING OF TRAFFIC to server and occupies   CPU,memory and network band of the web server.
->on doing this the clients which are trying to send the requests to server and waiting for the response can't    be able to access the Web server or can't get the response and waits(This is normally called DENIAL OF          SERVICE) or gets cancelled because web server's all resources has been taken by the malicious computers.
->basically a cyber attack on a specific server or network with the intended purpose of disrupting that network   or servers normal operation and a DDoS attack does this by flooding the targeted network or server with a     constant flood of traffic such as fraudulent requests which overwhelms the system causing a disruption or       denial of service to legitimate traffic.
->if only one computer is attacking on the server , then we can pin point to it using some algorithms to track    or something else, but if we have large number of computers attacking on the server, server can't know them,    and all computers(botnet which is a collection of large number of attacking computers) are sometimes            instructed by a singlee computer that is why we call this as DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE.
->DOS attack is an attack that's just coming from one source now normally a network or server is able to handle  an attack from a single source because it's easier to pinpoint the server can just simply close the connection  where the attack is coming from so that's not really a problem however the problem is that what if an attack  comes from multiple sources simultaneously and that is what a DDoS is a DDoS is an attack from multiple  sources all at once


						Types of DDOS attacks:
						----------------------
1)UDP Flood:
  A UDP flood, by definition, is any DDoS attack that floods a target with User Datagram Protocol (UDP)   packets. The goal of the attack is to flood random ports on a remote host. This causes the host to repeatedly  check for the application listening at that port,
2)HTTP Flood
3)ICMP(ping) Flood
4)SYN Flood
5)Ping of Death etc
