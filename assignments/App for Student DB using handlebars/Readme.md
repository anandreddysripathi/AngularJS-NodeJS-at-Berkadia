Handlebars.js, or simply Handlebars, is a specialized client-side templating library that enables web developers to create semantic templates effectively.

Using Handlebars for templating leads to the creation of logic-free templates which ensures that the view and the code are isolated, helping preserve the Separation of Concerns principle. It is largely compatible with Mustache templates, which are a templating language specification that have proven their effectiveness over time and have many implementations for all the major programming languages.

Additionally, Handlebars provides a set of extensions on top of the Mustache template specification, such as helper methods and partials, as a means of extending the templating engine and creating more effective templates.
